# MakeUofT-2022-Snowman-Clock

This github contains all the source files that were used for either testing or demonstration purposes for the project Snowman Clock for MakeUofT 2022. The file named "Snowman_Clock_Final" is the latest version of the team's work on the project. The usage of the files can be found through their commit messages.

We have also fixed a bug in our code (one minute before the hackthon ends without time to reupload the video) so that the real time can also be displayed now on the LCD. Feel free to check the updated code and complementary demo on youTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRPU07Tc8fg). Thank you! 

Thank you for reviewing.
